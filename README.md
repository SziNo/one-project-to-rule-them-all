# Deployed to Vercel

https://one-project-to-rule-them-all.vercel.app/

This project is a Next.js v13 application that uses NextAuth for authentication, Tailwind CSS for styling, Mongoose for database modeling, and MongoDB for data storage. The application fetches data from The One API and allows users to view information about characters from the Lord of the Rings universe. Logged-in users can save characters to their favorites and view them on a protected route. They can also delete characters from their favorites on the favorites details page. This project showcases the use of modern web development technologies to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.
